	It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic 
	growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of education.
	For example, governments set education policies. They determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and 
	who can or must attend. International organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary
	education for all children.
    Many factors influence whether education is successful. Psychological factors include motivation, intelligence,
    and personality. Social factors, like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are often linked to discrimination.
   Further factors include educational technology, teacher quality, and parent involvement.
  The main field investigating education is called education studies. It examines what education is and 
  what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects it has, and how to improve it. It has many 
  subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education, sociology of education, economics of education,
  and comparative education. It also discusses the history of education. In pre-history, education happened informally
  through oral communication and imitation. With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented and the amount
  of knowledge grew. This caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly available
  to elites and religious groups.</p>
